# Essentials of Task Framework

## Task Framework
A systematic approach to do any task in an excellent way.

## Commitment
Completion without any excuses.

### Completion means
* Meeting the objective of the task
* Within the timeframe
* With Commitment
* Your self-esteem improves
* People's trust in you increases

### Few reasons why people can't stay committed
* Being in comfort zones
* Having resistances
* Being disorganised

---

## Objective
Getting complete clarity about the task that we are doing.

### Two important elements to consider in objective
* Taking clear instructions
* Understanding the outcomes of the task

### Few questions that help us get good clarity about the task
* What is the impact or value that we are going to generate?
* What is our vision of the final outcome?

### Without a clear and complete objective
* Our efforts are wasted
* Output doesn't serve the purpose
* Excess use of resources

### Few reasons why we may miss the objective
* Being inattentive
* Making assumptions
* Being casual

### Steps in the objective before you start the task
* Set a complete and clear objective
* Confirm the objective with the person who assigned the task
* Visualise the outcome of the task

---

## Time Frame
The time by when we should reach the objective.

### Time frame should be
* Specific
* Challenging and Practical

### With a time frame, there will be
* Increased efficiency
* Increased focus
* Increased problem solving ability

### Mistakes we do when setting time frames
* Setting ambitious time frames
* Not revising the time frames
* Compromising on the quality to meet the time frame

### Few reasons for missing time frame
* Not being focused on objective may create deviations and delay
* Spending too much time on quality
* Not having a proper execution level plan
* Not giving importance to time frame

---

## Quality
Quality affects the degree to which we meet the objective.

### How to ensure Quality
* Defining Quality Standards
* Creating Checklists

### Define Quality Standards
* Research on the standard of the work
* Depending on the resources, fix the standards for the task
* Keep them measurable

### Create Checklists
* A checklist is a list of specific actions to be performed in a given task.
* It is important because we can't always rely on our memory.
* Mark each item in the checklist as done once it's complete.

### Output with a substandard quality
* Does not fully satisfy the objective
* Requires rework, extra time and other resources

### Some reasons for missing out on quality
* Not setting measurable quality standards
* No tracking system in place
* Not creating checklists
* Not following checklists

---

## ELP
**Execution Level Planning**

A detailed plan of how we will execute the task. ELP gives us a step-by-step procedure to reach our objective within the timeframe.

### Four different stages in ELP
* Pre-ELP
* Creating Subtasks
* Task Flowchart
* Subtask Planning

#### Pre-ELP
* Understand what the task is
* Understand the objective of the task
* Understand the timeframe of the task

#### Creating Subtasks
* Divide task into subtasks

#### Task Flowchart
* Ordering the subtasks

#### Subtask Planning
* Define the objective, timeframe, quality, dependencies, resources for each subtask

### Without a proper ELP
* The time frame is not met
* The quality is substandard
* There is chaos, confusion, and missing of essential aspects

### Some reasons for missing the ELP
* Rushing to start the task as soon as possible
* Thinking that the plan is clear in our mind

## Efficiency and Creativity

### Efficiency
Reaching the objective using the least amount of resources possible.
* Resources include time, money, people, etc.
* **With efficiency:**
    * We save vital resources
    * Get more done with less resources
* **Ask yourself while planning:**
    * Can the plan be made more efficient?

### Creativity
Creating something new that adds value to the existing process.
* Everyone can be creative.
* **Ask yourself while planning:**
    * Can I be a bit more creative to reach the objective well?

---

## Task Review
A process that ensures we stick to our ELP and reach our objective within the timeframe. Review is done at regular intervals during the task & before closing the task.

In review, we check whether or not we are sticking to the following things for each subtask:
* Defined objectives
* Defined time frames
* Defined quality standards
* Defined checklists

Time intervals at which you're going to review should be decided while preparing the ELP.
* *Ex. At 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%*

### Frequency of review should be more
* For a new task
* In the beginning of any task

### Some reasons why we miss task review
* There is time pressure to complete the task
* Focused more on output over outcome

---

## Growth Mindset
A belief that our abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, effort, and learning from mistakes. It is the opposite of a fixed mindset, which assumes abilities are static.

### Why is a Growth Mindset essential for the Task Framework?
* **Embraces Challenges:** Views difficult tasks not as threats, but as opportunities to learn and grow, which strengthens Commitment.
* **Persists Through Setbacks:** Sees failure not as a sign of inability but as a necessary part of the learning process, crucial for navigating complex ELPs and meeting Timeframes.
* **Values Effort:** Understands that effort and deliberate practice are the pathways to mastery, leading to higher Quality and Efficiency.
* **Learns from Feedback:** Actively seeks and incorporates feedback during Task Reviews to improve the process and the outcome.

### Cultivating a Growth Mindset
* Acknowledge and embrace imperfections.
* View challenges as opportunities.
* Replace the word "failing" with "learning".
* Focus on the process over the end result.
* Value effort and dedication over "talent".

---

## Outcome vs Output
A critical distinction for understanding the true purpose of any task.

### Output
* The tangible, measurable result of completing a task or a series of tasks.
* It is what you *produce*.
* *Example: A 50-page market research report.*

### Outcome
* The value, impact, or change that the output creates.
* It is the *why* behind the task and what you *achieve*.
* *Example: The leadership team making an informed decision to enter a new market based on the insights from the report.*

### Why focus on the Outcome?
* **Ensures Purposeful Work:** Focusing on the outcome aligns your efforts with the bigger picture, ensuring your work has a real impact. It is the core of a clear Objective.
* **Defines True Quality:** The quality of an output is ultimately judged by how well it achieves the desired outcome.
* **Prevents Wasted Effort:** Producing a perfect output that doesn't lead to the desired outcome is a waste of resources.

---

## Being Organized
The practice of systematically arranging tasks, information, and resources to achieve objectives efficiently. It's the foundation upon which the entire Task Framework is built.

### The Impact of Being Organized
* **Clarity and Focus:** Reduces mental clutter, allowing you to focus on the task at hand.
* **Supports ELP:** A well-organized person can create a more effective Execution Level Plan (ELP) by easily identifying subtasks, dependencies, and resources.
* **Upholds Commitment:** Eliminates the chaos and stress that lead to procrastination and broken commitments. A key reason people can't stay committed is being disorganised.
* **Enhances Efficiency:** Prevents time from being wasted searching for information or figuring out what to do next.

### Key Practices for Staying Organized
* **Prioritize Tasks:** Use methods like the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent/Important) to decide what to work on first.
* **Use a System:** Employ tools like calendars for timeframes, to-do lists for tasks, and note-taking apps for information.
* **Maintain a Clean Workspace:** Both physical and digital workspaces should be clutter-free to promote focus.
* **Break It Down:** Deconstruct large projects into smaller, manageable subtasks, as outlined in the ELP.
