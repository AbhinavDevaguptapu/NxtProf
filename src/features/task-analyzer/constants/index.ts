# Essentials of Task Framework

## Task Framework
A systematic approach to do any task in an excellent way.

### Elements in Task Framework
* Commitment
* Objective
* Timeframe
* Quality
* ELP
* Efficiency and Creativity
* Task Review

---

## Commitment
Completion without any excuses.

### Completion means
* Meeting the objective of the task
* Within the timeframe
* With Commitment
* Your self-esteem improves
* People's trust in you increases

### Few reasons why people can't stay committed
* Being in comfort zones
* Having resistances
* Being disorganised

---

## Objective
Getting complete clarity about the task that we are doing.

### Two important elements to consider in objective
* Taking clear instructions
* Understanding the outcomes of the task

### Few questions that help us get good clarity about the task
* What is the impact or value that we are going to generate?
* What is our vision of the final outcome?

### Without a clear and complete objective
* Our efforts are wasted
* Output doesn't serve the purpose
* Excess use of resources

### Few reasons why we may miss the objective
* Being inattentive
* Making assumptions
* Being casual

### Steps in the objective before you start the task
* Set a complete and clear objective
* Confirm the objective with the person who assigned the task
* Visualise the outcome of the task

---

## Time Frame
The time by when we should reach the objective.

### Time frame should be
* Specific
* Challenging and Practical

### With a time frame, there will be
* Increased efficiency
* Increased focus
* Increased problem solving ability

### Mistakes we do when setting time frames
* Setting ambitious time frames
* Not revising the time frames
* Compromising on the quality to meet the time frame

### Few reasons for missing time frame
* Not being focused on objective may create deviations and delay
* Spending too much time on quality
* Not having a proper execution level plan
* Not giving importance to time frame

---

## Quality
Quality affects the degree to which we meet the objective.

### How to ensure Quality
* Defining Quality Standards
* Creating Checklists

### Define Quality Standards
* Research on the standard of the work
* Depending on the resources, fix the standards for the task
* Keep them measurable

### Create Checklists
* A checklist is a list of specific actions to be performed in a given task.
* It is important because we can't always rely on our memory.
* Mark each item in the checklist as done once it's complete.

### Output with a substandard quality
* Does not fully satisfy the objective
* Requires rework, extra time and other resources

### Some reasons for missing out on quality
* Not setting measurable quality standards
* No tracking system in place
* Not creating checklists
* Not following checklists

---

## ELP
**Execution Level Planning**

A detailed plan of how we will execute the task. ELP gives us a step-by-step procedure to reach our objective within the timeframe.

### Four different stages in ELP
* Pre-ELP
* Creating Subtasks
* Task Flowchart
* Subtask Planning

#### Pre-ELP
* Understand what the task is
* Understand the objective of the task
* Understand the timeframe of the task

#### Creating Subtasks
* Divide task into subtasks

#### Task Flowchart
* Ordering the subtasks

#### Subtask Planning
* Define the objective, timeframe, quality, dependencies, resources for each subtask

### Without a proper ELP
* The time frame is not met
* The quality is substandard
* There is chaos, confusion, and missing of essential aspects

### Some reasons for missing the ELP
* Rushing to start the task as soon as possible
* Thinking that the plan is clear in our mind

---

## Efficiency and Creativity

### Efficiency
Reaching the objective using the least amount of resources possible.
* Resources include time, money, people, etc.
* **With efficiency:**
    * We save vital resources
    * Get more done with less resources
* **Ask yourself while planning:**
    * Can the plan be made more efficient?

### Creativity
Creating something new that adds value to the existing process.
* Everyone can be creative.
* **Ask yourself while planning:**
    * Can I be a bit more creative to reach the objective well?

---

## Task Review
A process that ensures we stick to our ELP and reach our objective within the timeframe. Review is done at regular intervals during the task & before closing the task.

In review, we check whether or not we are sticking to the following things for each subtask:
* Defined objectives
* Defined time frames
* Defined quality standards
* Defined checklists

Time intervals at which you're going to review should be decided while preparing the ELP.
* *Ex. At 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%*

### Frequency of review should be more
* For a new task
* In the beginning of any task

### Some reasons why we miss task review
* There is time pressure to complete the task
* Focused more on output over outcome

---

## Growth Mindset

## Outcome vs Output

## Reporting

## Being Organized

## Learning Hour
The practice of analyzing the way we execute things. It helps us increase our performance day by day.

### How to do a Learning Hour
At the end of the day or twice a day, analyse the tasks that you have done on that day and list down the following points:
* Round 1: Improvements
* Round 2: Best Practices
* Round 3: Appreciation / Praise

### Our focus during R1 - Improvements
* **Problem** - The mistake that happened
* **Core Point Missed** - The core/underlying reason why the mistake happened
* **Action Items** - Specific steps that you are going to take to not repeat the same mistake

### Attitude during R1 - When you list improvements
* Look for as many improvement areas as possible
* Come up with specific action items

### Our focus during R2 - Best Practices
* The points that worked out well in your execution

### Our focus during R3 - Appreciation / Praise
 
* Self-Praise - Acknowledge something you did well today
* Peer-Praise - Recognize someone who helped you or made your day easier
* Gratitude - Express thanks for support, resources, or insights received

### Implementation of action items from learning hour
* **Every day**
    * Refer to the action items in the morning
    * Include one-time action item in the day plan
* **Every week**
    * Identify Patterns
    * Check if you are implementing your action items

### Key Points
* Analyse your actions but don't judge yourself
* Act on Action Items
* Use only Task framework language
* Don't worry about the mistakes, feel happy about the progress you're going to make
* Celebrate successes—big or small—and acknowledge the support you received
