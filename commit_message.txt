refactor(peer-feedback): Improve module structure and robustness

This commit refactors the peer-feedback module to enhance code quality, maintainability, and readability without altering any user-facing functionality.

Key improvements include:

- Extracted employee fetching logic from `EmployeeFeedbackList` into a new `useAvailableEmployees` custom hook. This centralizes data fetching and cleans up the component, aligning it with existing patterns in the module.

- Refactored the `calculateOverallRating` utility to use a more declarative, threshold-based approach for determining star ratings. Renamed `finalRating` to `starRating` for better clarity.

- Enhanced timestamp handling in the `useReceivedFeedback` hook to safely filter out entries lacking a valid timestamp, preventing potential data inconsistencies.
